      I started making acrylic sculptures for my own use in floral design for
      flower shows. This lead to sharing with my Garden Club friends.

      As a NGC Master Flower Show Judge, I try to make things that can be used
      by designers for creative design. 
       
      Most of my pieces come apart for easy transport and storage.  Many can be
      used in a variety of ways.  I also have accent pieces in various colors
      which add a dramatic effect when added to a creative container or metal
      sculpture.
